abstract: Imaging the internal chemical structure of molecules remains an
  ongoing challenge. Noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) with a CO
  functionalized probe tip is a powerful tool for molecular structure
  characterizations. For many organic molecules, the visualization of individual
  atoms is a real possibility using nc-AFM, save for the complexity of
  interpreting the measured images. In order to gain a better understanding of
  such images, we employ real-space pseudopotentials constructed within density
  functional theory code, PARSEC, to simulate nc-AFM images. We are able to
  discriminate functional groups (such as -Câ‰¡C-, -CH2 and -C=O groups) and
  heteroatoms (such as O, N and S atoms) in organic molecules by mapping our
  simulated images to experimental images. Also, we find that nc-AFM is capable
  of directly visualizing the orientation of organic molecules at varies
  adsorption sites on metal substrates.
