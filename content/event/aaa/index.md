title: Discriminating functional groups, atomic species and molecular geometries
  in organic molecules using real-space simulations of non-contact atomic force
  microscopy
abstract: Noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) with a CO functionalized
  probe tip is a powerful tool for molecular structure characterizations. In
  many organic molecules, the visualization of individual atoms is a real
  possibility, save for the complexity of interpreting the nc-AFM images. In
  order to gain a better understanding of such experimental images, we employ a
  real-space pseudopotential constructed within density functional theory code,
  PARSEC, to simulate nc-AFM images. We are able to discriminate functional
  groups (such as -Câ‰¡C-, -CH2 and -C=O groups) and heteroatoms (such as O, N and
  S atoms) in organic molecules by mapping our simulated images to experimental
  images. Also, we find that nc-AFM is capable of directly visualizing the
  orientation of organic molecules at varies adsorption sites on metal
  substrates. This can be very useful for characterizing large long-chain
  organic molecules in heavy oils and asphaltenes.
