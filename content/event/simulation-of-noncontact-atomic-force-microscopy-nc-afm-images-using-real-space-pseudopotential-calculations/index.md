title: Simulation of Noncontact Atomic Force Microscopy (nc-AFM) Images Using
  Real-Space Pseudopotential Calculations
abstract: >-
  Within the past few years, scanning probe microscopy has made remarkable
  progress in molecular structure characterizations. In particular, operating
  AFM under constant height (noncontact) mode typically with a proper
  functionalized tip in ultrahigh vacuum and at low temperature has yielded high
  resolution snapshots of covalent bond structures of organic molecules.
  However, interpreting the experimental nc-AFM images remains a challenge. This
  problem becomes even more complicated when it comes to petroleum chemistry. In
  order to gain a better understanding of experimental images, we employ a
  real-space pseudopotential constructed within density functional theory code,
  PARSEC, to simulate nc-AFM images. Our approach allows us to discriminate
  functional groups (such as -C≡C-, -CH2 and -C=O groups) and heteroatoms (such
  as O, N and S atoms) in organic molecules. For example, we choose the acridine
  (ACR) molecule as an example of illustration in Ref [1]. We propose a
  systematic change in the tip functionalization to determine the structures of
  N containing molecules.

    indicated by the arrow in the inset structural image of the ACR molecule as
    a function of the x position (Å) at different tip heights. The dashed curve
    corresponds to the CO tip, and the solid curves correspond to the Cu tip.
    The three vertical dashed lines indicate the positions of the edge C, N, and
    C atoms. (b) Experimental AFM image of ACR (CO tip); (c)-(e) simulated
