abstract: "Noncontact mode of atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) employing a
  CO-functionalized tip is a very powerful tool for studying molecular
  structures. However, interpreting nc-AFM images for nonplanar molecules can
  sometimes be problematic. To illustrate and resolve the nature of such
  problematic systems, we employ real-space pseudopotentials constructed within
  density functional theory to simulate nc-AFM images. We focus on several
  representative nonplanar organic molecules (pentacene, naphthanthrone,
  olympicene, and 6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triynybenzene (PHTB)) on a typical
  substrate: the Cu (111) surface. This substrate results in significant
  distortions in the molecular geometries of pentacene and naphthanthrone.
  Including these distortions in simulated nc-AFM imaging notably improves the
  agreement between the simulated and measured images. In naphthanthrone, the
  relatively large interaction between the O atom and the Cu substrate offers a
  straightforward explanation for the absence of the C = O bond in the measured
  image. Nonplanar features such as tilting or twisting are also apparent in
  olympicene and PHTB. A “triangular” bright feature associated with the −CH2
  group in olympicene appears in simulated and measured nc-AFM images. This
  feature is directly related to the tilting angle of the molecule with respect
  to the Cu substrate. The “defective” benzene ring feature and the faint
  ellipsoidal C ≡ C feature in PHTB can be ascribed to its twisted nature. The
  ability to simulate such subatomic images in nc-AFM reflects the accuracy and
  efficiency of calculating quantum forces in real space."
