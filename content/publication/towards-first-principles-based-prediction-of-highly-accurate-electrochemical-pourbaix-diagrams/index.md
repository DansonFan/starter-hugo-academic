abstract: Electrochemical potential/pH (Pourbaix) diagrams underpin many aqueous
  electrochemical processes and are central to the identification of stable
  phases of metals for processes ranging from electrocatalysis to corrosion.
  Even though standard DFT calculations are potentially powerful tools for the
  prediction of such diagrams, inherent errors in the description of transition
  metal (hydroxy)oxides, together with neglect of van der Waals interactions,
  have limited the reliability of such predictions for even the simplest pure
  metal bulk compounds, and corresponding predictions for more complex alloy or
  surface structures are even more challenging. In the present work, through
  synergistic use of a Hubbard U correction, a state-of-the-art dispersion
  correction, and a water-based bulk reference state for the calculations, these
  errors are systematically corrected. The approach describes the weak binding
  that occurs between hydroxyl-containing functional groups in certain compounds
  in Pourbaix diagrams, corrects for self-interaction errors in transition metal
  compounds, and reduces residual errors on oxygen atoms by preserving a
  consistent oxidation state between the reference state, water, and the
  relevant bulk phases. The strong performance is illustrated on a series of
  bulk transition metal (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) hydroxides, oxyhydroxides, binary,
  and ternary oxides, where the corresponding thermodynamics of redox and
  (de)hydration are described with standard errors of 0.04 eV per reaction
  formula unit. The approach further preserves accurate descriptions of the
  overall thermodynamics of electrochemically relevant bulk reactions, such as
  water formation, which is an essential condition for facilitating accurate
  analysis of reaction energies for electrochemical processes on surfaces. The
  overall generality and transferability of the scheme suggests that it may find
  useful application in the construction of a broad array of electrochemical
  phase diagrams, including both bulk Pourbaix diagrams and surface phase
  diagrams of interest for corrosion and electrocatalysis.
