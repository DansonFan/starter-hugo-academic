abstract: Noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) with a CO-functionalized
  tip yields high resolution images under many situations. However, nc-AFM
  images are sometimes difficult to interpret when visualizing polycyclic
  aromatic hydrocarbons. The authors employ real-space pseudopotentials
  constructed using density functional theory to simulate nc-AFM images of
  benzene and dibenzo(cd,n)naphtho(3,2,1,8-pqra)perylene molecules with selected
  probe tips (such as CO, H2, N2, Br, and CH2O). The selected tips provide
  accurate simulations, save for the tip functionalized with a Br atom. The
  authors find contrast inversion with CO and N2 tips at small tip heights and
  image distortion with the CH2O tip.
