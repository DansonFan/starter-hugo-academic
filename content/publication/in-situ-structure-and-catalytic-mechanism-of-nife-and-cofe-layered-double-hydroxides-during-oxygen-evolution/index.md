abstract: NiFe and CoFe (MFe) layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are among the
  most active electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
  Herein, we combine electrochemical measurements, operando X-ray scattering and
  absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
  elucidate the catalytically active phase, reaction center and the OER
  mechanism. We provide the first direct atomic-scale evidence that, under
  applied anodic potentials, MFe LDHs oxidize from as-prepared α-phases to
  activated γ-phases. The OER-active γ-phases are characterized by about 8%
  contraction of the lattice spacing and switching of the intercalated ions. DFT
  calculations reveal that the OER proceeds via a Mars van Krevelen mechanism.
  The flexible electronic structure of the surface Fe sites, and their synergy
  with nearest-neighbor M sites through formation of O-bridged Fe-M reaction
  centers, stabilize OER intermediates that are unfavorable on pure M-M centers
  and single Fe sites, fundamentally accounting for the high catalytic activity
  of MFe LDHs.
