abstract: Bond breaking and forming are essential components of chemical
  reactions. Recently, the structure and formation of covalent bonds in single
  molecules have been studied by non-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM).
  Here, we report the details of a single dative bond breaking process using
  non-contact AFM. The dative bond between carbon monoxide and ferrous
  phthalocyanine was ruptured via mechanical forces applied by atomic force
  microscope tips; the process was quantitatively measured and characterized
  both experimentally and via quantum-based simulations. Our results show that
  the bond can be ruptured either by applying an attractive force of ~150 pN or
  by a repulsive force of ~220 pN with a significant contribution of shear
  forces, accompanied by changes of the spin state of the system. Our combined
  experimental and computational studies provide a deeper understanding of the
  chemical bond breaking process.
