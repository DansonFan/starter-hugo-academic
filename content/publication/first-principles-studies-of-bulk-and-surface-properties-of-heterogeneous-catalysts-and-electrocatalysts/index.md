abstract: "Activity and stability are two equally important fundamental
  properties in heterogeneous catalysts and electrocatalysts for energy
  conversion and storage. Recent studies have shown that the activity and
  stability of a catalyst is inversely related to each other. In comparison with
  the research has been done on activity, the understanding of stability is much
  less advanced.[1] The stability of a catalyst is characterized by itsâ€™
  resistance toward dissolution or sintering/agglomeration, for which the bulk
  or surface segregation is usually the first step. Thus, studying surface and
  bulk segregation is a key step to understand the stability of a catalyst. In
  the present paper, two segregation phenomena have been studied: CO adsorption
  induced alloy surface segregation and mixed (oxy)hydroxide bulk segregation.
  Since adsorbed CO is a common intermediate in catalysis and it is known to
  restructure catalysts, but the process by which this restructuring occurs is
  not well understood.[2] We first studied CO driven surface segregation
  phenomena occurring on bimetallic near-surface-alloys (NSAs). Pt-Au systems
  and Pd-Au systems were studied at different CO coverage. The stability of each
  configuration was tested by calculating the segregation energy in each
  scenario. The most general trend we find is that Au atoms prefer to stay on
  the surface. In another word, as for the systems we studied, any upward
  movement of Au atoms is thermodynamically favorable. In the second part, the
  segregation of Mn, Fe, Co and Ni binary mixtures are tested using DFT+U
  approach with known U values because Mn, Fe, Co, Ni compounds and mixed
  (oxy)hydroxides are excellent electrocatalysts, especially for oxygen
  evolution reaction (OER). But bulk structures and stability of the mixtures
  are still unclear.[3] We find that binary mixtures that have Ni atom involved
  were relatively stable. As an extension of DFT+U method, we have performed
  U-fitting for titanium oxides, which are commonly used as heterogeneous
  catalyst supports and as photocatalysts, by comparing the reaction energies
  for the oxidation of TiO and Ti2O3 with experimental data. We find that U=7.08
  eV is the optimal value that could accurately describe all the reactions."
