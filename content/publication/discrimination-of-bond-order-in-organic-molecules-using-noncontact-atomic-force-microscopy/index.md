abstract: Noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) with a CO-functionalized
  tip can image submolecular structures through high-resolution images with the
  possibility of discriminating bond order. We employ real-space pseudopotential
  calculations to simulate nc-AFM images of molecules containing double
  (dibenzo(cd,n)naphtho(3,2,1,8-pqra)perylene (DBNP),
  hexabenzo(bc,ef,hi,kl,no,qr)coronene (HBC)) and triple
  (1,2-bis[2-(2-ethynylphenyl)ethynyl]-benzene (BEEB),
  6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triynylbenzene (PHTB)) bonds. We find (1) triple bonds can
  be unambiguously distinguished from other interatomic interactions based on a
  characteristic image and (2) the degree of double bond character can be
  directly determined from the image. We propose that large lateral forces
  acting on the tip may induce specific image distortions in the cases of DBNP
  and BEEB.
