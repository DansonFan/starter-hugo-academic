abstract: A scanning probe with an atomically sharp tip is used in atomic force
  microscopy. As the probe is rastered over the specimen of interest, changes in
  its vibration mode can be ascribed to changes in the interatomic forces
  between the specimen and the tip. Various modes for implementing atomic force
  measures exist. One of the most successful modes is frequency-modulation
  noncontact atomic force microscopy. Here we address the role of replicating
  accurate forces on the probe tip to simulate images within this mode. We
  examine several approaches. One involves the use of classical force fields
  based on interatomic potentials, where the potentials are often fit to
  experiment. Other approaches center on the use of forces generated from
  quantum-based calculations. We consider the development of a “virtual tip”
  approximation wherein the probe tip senses electrostatic forces generated by
  the specimen. This approach treats the specimen quantum mechanically, while
  the tip is treated as a classical object. We also consider the use of an
  embedding approximation to avoid direct computations of the specimen in the
  presence of the tip. In this method, the tip and specimen are treated quantum
  mechanically. However, the electronic structure of the specimen is computed in
  the absence of the probe tip. The electronic density of the specimen is then
  fixed and the electronic structure of the tip is then computed in the presence
  of the fixed density. As a general approach, we outline new methods for the
  full computation of quantum forces between the tip and specimen. We note that
  quantum-based forces are particularly important as they directly contain the
  chemical nature of the forces present without the use of any adjustable
  parameters. We illustrate recent algorithmic developments to computing quantum
  forces that can produce accurate simulations of atomic force microscopy images
  for large and complex molecular species. We also suggest new pathways to
  overcome current challenges in this rapidly evolving field.
