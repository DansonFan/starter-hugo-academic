abstract: Immense strides have been made in increasing the resolution of
  scanning probe microscopy. Noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) now
  offers one the ability to characterize and visualize single molecules with
  subatomic resolution. Specifically, nc-AFM with a carbon monoxide (CO)
  functionalized tip has the ability to discriminate functional groups (–C=C–,
  –CH2, –C=O, …), although discriminating atomic species often remains as an
  ongoing challenge. Here, real-space pseudopotentials constructed within
  density functional theory are employed to accurately simulate nc-AFM images of
  molecules containing heteroatoms (S, I, and N) within dibenzothiophene (DBT),
  2-iodotriphenylene (ITP), acridine (ACR) and ferrous phthalocyanine (FePc). It
  is found that S and I atoms can be easily identified from C based on their
  unique features. For N atoms, a use of tip functionalization is proposed to
  effectively discriminate them from C atoms.
